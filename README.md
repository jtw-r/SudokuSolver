### SudokuSolver_Try1 is my first, and *only*, attempt at making a working sudoku puzzle solver.

You may be thinking "Well that takes the fun out of it" and yes, you would be right, but this application also has tools to help you solve it!

#### Some of those tools are:
- Handy grid
- Option to highlight rows and columns inline with the selected cell (click highlight.)
- Option to highlight/search and find occurances of numbers on the board (focus highlight.)
- Option to highlight possible spaces for a number.
- Option to autofill single possibilites.
- Option to solve it for you (auto cycle.)
- Plus a few other things not listed.

### *Sounds Great*, where do I **download** it?
Good question! [How about here](https://github.com/thejonathanr/SudokuSolver/files/969310/SudokuSolver_Try1.Executable.zip)
