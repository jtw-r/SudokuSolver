### SudokuSolver_Try1 is my first, and only, attempt at making a working sudoku puzzle solver.

You may be thinking "Well that takes the fun out of it" and yes, you would be right, but this application also has tools to help you solve it!

#### Some of those tools are:
- Handy grid
- Option to highlight rows and columns inline with the selected cell
- Option to highlight/search and find occurances of numbers on the board
- Option to highlight possible spaces for a number
- Option to autofill single possibilites.
- Option to solve it for you (auto cycle)

### *Sounds Great*, where do I download it?
Good question! [How about here]()
